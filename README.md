# What is this?
In this project, I will be working with Bash Scripting to make login over a ssh network easier and the OS system I am using is Kali Linux.

# What does this do?
The script is simple: normally when you try to login into a ssh network, first you need to go to the ssh port address then using the password you will get access through the ssh address but the bash script will tell you what is the username and password so it easier for you to have everything there for you similar to logging into a game or any website. 

# Installation:
1. download the bash script code from Github 
2. install it into your OS system 
3. follow the instruction from the video
